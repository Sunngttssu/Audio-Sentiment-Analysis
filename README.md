# Audio-Sentiment-Analysis using DL & NLP

## 🎙️ Overview

Understanding emotions through voice is a key aspect of building human-centered AI systems. This project explores Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, trained on the RAVDESS and TESS datasets. The goal is to automatically detect emotions from speech signals and enhance emotional intelligence in AI applications.
